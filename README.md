# County Health Data
This repository was created for Professor Gotzlers's English 105 class at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill
- It contains a .csv file of the United States County Health Data from 2014-15
- It also contains an idividual data subset of this data showing the homicide rate and cost of healthcare in NC. This was created through the use of Python.
- The Python notebook is also included in here, along with the steps for creating a subset.
# What is the purpose of this repository?
- The purpose of this repository is to showcase the Public Health Data per county in the US.
- The repository also includes the homicide rate and health care cost in every county in NC, which shows a correlation between higher healthcare cost and an increased homicide rate.
- Health care is more expensive in rural areas than in urban areas, even though rural areas are more impoverished. This increases poverty, which has a direct correlation to a higher homicide rate.
# Where is the data from?
- This data is from the US Public Health Data set from 2014-15, that was provided by Steven Gotzler.
# What could this data be used for?
- The subset of the cost of healthcare and homicide rate data in NC can be used to bring awareness to the fact that rural areas are paying more in health cost, than the more affluent urban areas.
- This aggravates poverty even further in rural areas and has negative side effects, such as an increased homicide rate.
# Data Visualization
